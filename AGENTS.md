## Absolute Rules

**DO**: Use `gzh-cli-core` for utilities · Read `cmd/AGENTS_COMMON.md` before modifying · Run `make quality-check` before every commit · Sanitize all git inputs · 80%+ test coverage for core logic

**DON'T**: Use `sh -c` (command injection) · Concatenate user input into commands · Log credentials · Commit without security tests

## Configuration System

**5-Layer Precedence** (highest → lowest):

1. Command flags (`--provider gitlab`)
1. Project config (`.gz-git.yaml`)
1. Active profile (`~/.config/gz-git/profiles/{active}.yaml`)
1. Global config (`~/.config/gz-git/config.yaml`)
1. Built-in defaults

**Two formats**: `repositories` array (simple) or `workspaces` map (hierarchical)

**Branch config**: `defaultBranch: develop,master` — tries in order, falls back to repo default

```bash
gz-git config init && gz-git config profile create work && gz-git config profile use work
gz-git config show --effective    # Show effective config
```

Details: [config-guide.md](docs/.claude-context/config-guide.md)

## Core Design: Bulk-First

All commands operate in bulk mode by default.

```go
// pkg/repository/defaults.go
DefaultLocalScanDepth = 1   // local ops (status, fetch, pull...)
DefaultLocalParallel  = 10
DefaultForgeParallel  = 4   // lower for API rate limits
```

**Common flags**: `-d/--scan-depth` · `-j/--parallel` · `-n/--dry-run` · `--include/--exclude` · `-f/--format` (default|compact|json|llm) · `--full`

## Sync & Workspace Usage

```bash
# sync: all-in-one command
gz-git sync                    # auto-init if no .gz-git.yaml, else sync
gz-git sync --dry-run          # preview
gz-git sync --check            # sync + status after
gz-git sync -c config.yaml     # explicit config

# workspace detail
gz-git workspace init . -d 3   # scan depth 3
gz-git workspace sync --dry-run
gz-git workspace add https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

## Handoff Usage (multi-device / multi-agent)

`sync` aligns the **set** of repositories against a config. `handoff` moves the **work
state** of the repositories already present — do not confuse the two.

```bash
gz-git handoff check              # verdict: SAFE TO LEAVE / NOT YET / BLOCKED (no network)
gz-git handoff end                # commit + push everything movable, before leaving
gz-git handoff end --dry-run      # what would be committed, and what the guard flags
gz-git handoff end --no-push      # checkpoint offline
gz-git handoff start              # pull --rebase + prune, on arrival
```

`handoff end` screens every repository before committing: credential filenames and
contents, files over 5 MiB, untracked build output missing from `.gitignore`. Flagged
repositories are held back, not committed — `--force` overrides. Stash entries are never
moved automatically; they are invisible to every other machine by design.

Because of that, `handoff check` reports their age. A stash older than a week is
`stranded` rather than `stashed`: it has outlived several handoff cycles without anyone
reaching for it. `gz-git doctor` warns about the same entries, and neither command
touches them — restoring a stash is a decision, not a cleanup.

## Forge Usage

```bash
gz-git forge from --provider gitlab --org mygroup --path ~/repos \
  --base-url https://gitlab.com --token $GITLAB_TOKEN

# Filter: --language go --min-stars 100 --last-push-within 30d
# Subgroups: --include-subgroups --subgroup-mode flat

gz-git forge config generate --provider gitlab --org devbox -o .gz-git.yaml
gz-git forge status -c sync.yaml --verbose
```

**Health symbols**: `✓` healthy · `⚠` warning · `✗` error · `⊘` unreachable

## Retiring a Non-Canonical Branch

`--refspec develop:master` moves one ref and stops there, so a repository that
has been "synced" that way keeps a full duplicate of its trunk: `origin/master`
at the same commit as `origin/develop`, a stale local `master`, and an
`origin/HEAD` still pointing at the old name. Nothing in the merged/stale/gone
vocabulary reaches it — `master` is on the built-in protected list, so cleanup
reported it as protected and deleted nothing, forever.

```bash
gz-git cleanup branch --non-canonical -r            # preview
gz-git cleanup branch --non-canonical -r --force --yes
gz-git cleanup branch --non-canonical -r --force --yes .   # bulk, across a tree
```

`--non-canonical` is the only classification allowed past the built-in
protected-name list, so it earns that with a declaration rather than a name
guess. Every one of these must hold, and the check runs twice — once to
classify, once again to authorize the delete:

1. `.gz-git.yaml` declares `branch.integrationBranch`. Without it the command
   refuses (exit 1) instead of guessing which branch is canonical.
1. The branch is not that canonical branch, under any spelling.
1. The branch does not match a `--protect` pattern. The built-in list is what
   this path overrides; an explicit operator instruction is not.
1. The branch does not match a declared `branch.taskPattern`. Task branches have
   their own lifecycle.
1. `git merge-base --is-ancestor` says the branch holds no commit the canonical
   branch lacks. This is what makes the deletion lossless, and it is asked of
   git rather than inferred. Any git error fails closed.

A remote branch that is still the remote's default is refused by the remote
itself; repoint the default branch first, then re-run.

## Push with Refspec

```bash
gz-git push --refspec develop:master         # local:remote
gz-git push --refspec +develop:master        # raw force — refused unless forceMode: allow
```

## Push Policy

`push.policy` gates `push` and `handoff end`. Separate from
`branch.protectedBranches`, which only guards deletion.

```yaml
push:
  policy:
    protected: [main, master]   # never push here; the destination decides
    forceMode: lease-only       # lease-only (default) | allow | deny
    foreignWork: block          # block (default) | allow
```

`lease-only` allows `--force` (which uses `--force-with-lease`) and refuses a
`+` refspec, which has none — it applies even with no config file, so the two
force paths behave the same. `--force-mode` overrides it per invocation.
Refused repositories are reported as `blocked`; the rest of the batch runs.

`foreignWork: block` refuses a force push that would discard remote commits
whose trailers name a different device or agent, listing the commits at stake.
It catches what `--force-with-lease` cannot: a lease is satisfied by any fetch,
and a multi-device workflow fetches on arrival. `--foreign-work allow` overrides
it. Only commits signed by `handoff end` can be attributed — a commit made by
hand elsewhere has no trailer and is never counted as foreign.

## Identity

`handoff end` signs its checkpoint commit with git trailers, since the author
line is the same on every machine one person owns. The `foreignWork` rule and
`handoff start`'s shared-branch note both read them back.

```yaml
# global config only — a project's .gz-git.yaml is committed and shared
identity:
  device: dave-office   # default: hostname
  agent: hermes-01      # default: none (a person is driving)
```

`GZ_GIT_DEVICE` / `GZ_GIT_AGENT` override the config. `--no-trailers` omits
them for one run. A machine that names nothing skips the foreign-work check
entirely: it cannot tell its own commits from anyone else's.

## Branch Naming

`branch name` builds the branch name a task should have here, from a template
and the resolved identity. It prints the name and creates nothing — creation
stays with `switch --create` and plain git.

```bash
gz-git branch name task-001-product-unit                 # feat/task-001-product-unit
gz-git branch name task-001-product-unit --kind device   # feat/task-001-product-unit/dave-office
gz-git branch name task-001-product-unit --kind agent    # agent/task-001-product-unit/hermes-01

gz-git switch "$(gz-git branch name task-001 --kind device)" --create
```

```yaml
branch:
  naming:                          # defaults shown; override one, keep the rest
    work: feat/{task}
    device: feat/{task}/{device}
    agent: agent/{task}/{agent}
```

Every substituted value is slugified, since the default device name is the
hostname and `Daves-MacBook.local` is not a legal branch name. A `device` or
`agent` branch whose segment is unnamed is refused: it would be the shared
branch again under a longer name.

## Security (CRITICAL)

```go
// SAFE
cmd := exec.Command("git", "clone", url)

// DANGEROUS — NEVER
cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "git clone "+url)
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not sanitizing git inputs** → Use `internal/gitcmd`
1. **Shell execution** → Use `exec.Command("git", args...)`
1. **Logging credentials** → Strip URLs before logging
