# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project**: gzh-cli-git
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-27
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision

gzh-cli-git is a Git-specialized CLI tool and Go library that provides advanced Git automation capabilities. It serves dual purposes:

1. **Standalone CLI Tool**: Independent command-line interface for developers seeking advanced Git workflows
2. **Reusable Library**: Go package that can be imported into other projects, particularly as the Git engine for `gzh-cli`

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual commit message creation is time-consuming and inconsistent
- Branch and worktree management for parallel development is complex
- Analyzing Git history requires piecing together multiple commands
- Merge conflicts often require manual intervention and expertise
- Existing Git libraries lack clean, library-first design for embedding

**Impact:**
- Developers spend 15-20% of time on Git operations
- Inconsistent commit messages reduce code review efficiency
- Complex worktree workflows discourage parallel feature development
- Manual conflict resolution delays integration
- Tight coupling in existing tools prevents reusability

### 1.3 Solution

gzh-cli-git addresses these issues through:

1. **Commit Automation**: Template-based commit messages with conventional commits support
2. **Branch Management**: Simplified worktree and parallel workflow management
3. **History Analysis**: Rich commit statistics and contributor insights
4. **Advanced Merge/Rebase**: Intelligent conflict detection and auto-resolution
5. **Library-First Design**: Clean APIs for embedding in other Go projects
