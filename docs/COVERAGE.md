**Gaps**:
- Minimal, mostly unreachable code paths

**Recommendation**: Excellent coverage, no action needed

### pkg/history (87.7%)

**Strengths**:
- Statistics analysis: 93.3%
- Contributor tracking: High coverage
- File history: Well tested

**Gaps**:
- Some output formatting edge cases
- Rare error conditions

**Recommendation**: Exceeds target, maintain current level

### pkg/merge (82.9%)

**Strengths**:
- Conflict detection: 86.8%
- Merge strategies: Good coverage
- Basic workflows: Tested

**Gaps**:
- Complex rebase scenarios
- Some error recovery paths

**Recommendation**: Near target, add 5-10 tests for edge cases

### pkg/commit (66.3%)

**Strengths**:
- Template validation: 64.9%
- Message generation: Partial coverage
- Basic operations: Tested

**Gaps**:
- Advanced template features
- Custom template validation
- Some generator edge cases

**Recommendation**: Add 15-20 tests to reach 85% target

### pkg/branch (48.1%)

**Strengths**:
- Basic operations: 37.9%
- List functionality: Partial coverage

**Gaps**:
- Worktree operations: Minimal coverage
- Branch cleanup: Not well tested
- Advanced features: Limited tests

**Recommendation**: Add 30-40 tests, focus on worktree and cleanup

### pkg/repository (39.2%)

**Strengths**:
- Core operations: 57.7%
- Status handling: Partial coverage

**Gaps**:
- Clone operations: Minimal coverage
- Logger implementations: Not tested (interface methods)
- Progress tracking: Not tested
- Many helper methods: Untested

**Recommendation**: Add 40-50 tests, focus on clone and helpers

### cmd/gzh-git (0.0%)

**Current State**:
- CLI commands: 0% direct coverage
- Tested via integration/E2E tests

**Gaps**:
- No unit tests for command handlers
- Flag parsing not unit tested
- Output formatting not directly tested

**Recommendation**: CLI is well-tested through integration/E2E tests; unit tests would be redundant

## Coverage Targets

### Current Targets

- **pkg/** packages: 85% (avg: 60.7%)
- **internal/** packages: 80% (avg: 92.6%)
- **cmd/** commands: 70% (avg: 0.0%)

### Achievement Status

- ✅ **internal/**: 92.6% - **EXCEEDS** 80% target
- ⚠️ **pkg/**: 60.7% - Below 85% target (25% gap)
- ⚠️ **cmd/**: 0.0% - Below 70% target (but integration tested)

### Path to 85% Overall Coverage

To reach 85% overall coverage from current 69.1%:

1. **Increase pkg/repository**: 39.2% → 70% (+30.8%)
   - Impact: +7% overall
   - Effort: ~40 tests

2. **Increase pkg/branch**: 48.1% → 75% (+26.9%)
   - Impact: +5% overall
   - Effort: ~35 tests

3. **Increase pkg/commit**: 66.3% → 80% (+13.7%)
   - Impact: +3% overall
   - Effort: ~15 tests

4. **Increase pkg/merge**: 82.9% → 90% (+7.1%)
   - Impact: +1% overall
   - Effort: ~8 tests

**Total Effort**: ~98 additional tests to reach 85% overall

## Uncovered Code Analysis

### Critical Uncovered Paths

1. **pkg/repository**:
   - Clone operations with various protocols
   - Logger implementations (WriterLogger, NoopLogger)
   - Progress tracking callbacks

2. **pkg/branch**:
   - Worktree add/remove/list
   - Branch cleanup strategies
   - Remote branch operations

3. **pkg/commit**:
   - Custom template loading
   - Advanced message generation
   - Template validation rules

### Low Priority Uncovered

- Interface method stubs (NoopLogger, NoopProgress)
- Debugging/logging code paths
- Unreachable error conditions

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Short Term (Next Sprint)

1. **pkg/repository**: Add clone integration tests
2. **pkg/branch**: Add worktree operation tests
3. **pkg/commit**: Add template feature tests

**Expected Impact**: +10% overall coverage

### Medium Term (Next Month)

1. Complete pkg/* coverage to 80%+
2. Add edge case tests for all packages
3. Improve error path coverage

**Expected Impact**: +15% overall coverage

### Long Term

1. Maintain 85%+ coverage on all new code
2. Add property-based tests for parsers
3. Performance regression tests

## Coverage Maintenance

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Run coverage check in CI
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}'

# Fail if below threshold
coverage=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
if (( $(echo "$coverage < 65.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "Coverage $coverage% is below 65% threshold"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Coverage Report Generation

```bash
# Generate HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# View in browser
open coverage.html
```

### Continuous Monitoring

- Track coverage trends over time
- Alert on coverage decreases
- Require coverage for new code

## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Excellent coverage in internal packages (92.6%)
- ✅ Strong coverage in history package (87.7%)
- ✅ Comprehensive integration and E2E testing
- ✅ All tests passing

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ pkg/repository and pkg/branch need significant work
- ⚠️ Some packages below 85% target
- ⚠️ CLI commands have 0% direct coverage (mitigated by integration tests)

### Quality Score: B+

- Testing infrastructure: A
- Coverage breadth: B
- Coverage depth: B+
- Test quality: A

### Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Add tests for pkg/repository clone operations
