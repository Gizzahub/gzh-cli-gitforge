# Troubleshooting

Symptom-first guide for `gz-git`. For what a command does, see the
[command reference](../../commands/README.md); for what this project is, see the
[FAQ](faq.md).

## `info` shows `↑N` but `push` reports "up-to-date"

Both are right — they measure different things. `info` prints divergence in two
columns and both use the same `↑N ↓N` glyphs:

| Column   | Compares HEAD against                        | Moved by           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `BRANCH` | its upstream (`@{upstream}`)                 | `push` / `pull`    |
| `BASE`   | the **local** base branch (`master`, `main`) | `merge` / `rebase` |

`push` only ever acts on the `BRANCH` axis. A repository that is fully pushed —
`BRANCH` blank — can still show a large `BASE` count, and `push` reporting
`up-to-date` for it is accurate.

The table prints a legend under the summary line naming both comparisons:

```text
126 repositories  ·  3.06s  ·  12 need attention
BRANCH ↑↓ = vs upstream  ·  BASE ↑↓ = vs base branch
```

Confirm either axis by hand — left count is ahead, right is behind:

```bash
git -C <repo> rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}   # BRANCH axis
git -C <repo> rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...master        # BASE axis
```

### Why `BASE` is often large

The base is resolved to a **local** ref, and nothing moves it on its own:
`git fetch` updates `refs/remotes/*`, `git pull` updates the branch you are
standing on, and a base you never check out is neither. On a develop-based
workflow the local `master` stays wherever it was at clone time, so
`BASE ↑1275` means "develop holds 1275 commits your stale local master lacks",
not "1275 unpushed commits".

Repair it in bulk, without checking it out and without touching the branch you
are on:

```bash
gz-git update --sync-base -d 2 ~/projects
```

This fast-forwards each stale base ref and reports which ones moved. Preview
with `--dry-run` first.

### When the base holds commits the remote lacks

That is not a fast-forward, so the ref cannot simply catch up — and the two
situations it can mean are opposites:

- The base is parked on the tip of a task branch that **was** pushed. Every
  commit is reachable from some remote-tracking ref, so moving the pointer
  loses nothing. This is adopted: `base master +12 (adopted: 2 local commit(s) already pushed elsewhere; old tip at refs/gz-git/base-backup/master)`.
- The base carries commits that exist **nowhere else** — never pushed, on no
  branch the remote has. Moving the pointer would leave them reachable only
  from the reflog. This is refused: `base master blocked: 2 commit(s) exist only here`.

The count that decides is "commits on the local base reachable from no
remote-tracking ref", not "commits the remote base lacks". A blocked base is
reported and left exactly as it was; resolve it by pushing the commits
somewhere, then run again.

#### The backup ref, and why adopting needs one

Note the exact wording above: *reachable from a remote-tracking ref*, not *on
the remote*. Those are not the same claim. `refs/remotes/origin/*` is a local
cache — a tracking ref for a branch someone deleted upstream survives until the
next `fetch --prune`, and until then it stands as evidence for a commit that is
no longer anywhere. The decision can therefore be wrong in exactly one
direction, and it is the expensive one.

So an adopt parks the old tip before it moves the ref:

```bash
git -C <repo> for-each-ref refs/gz-git/base-backup/   # what was moved off
git -C <repo> branch recovered refs/gz-git/base-backup/master
```

They live under `refs/gz-git/` rather than `refs/heads/`, so they never show up
in `git branch` and can never be picked as a base on a later run. Delete one
with `git update-ref -d refs/gz-git/base-backup/<base>` once you are satisfied.

An adopt that only rewinds — the local base was strictly *ahead* of its remote
— says so rather than reporting a distance of zero:

```text
base master rewound to origin (adopted: 2 local commit(s) already pushed elsewhere; old tip at refs/gz-git/base-backup/master)
```

### A sync that failed is not a sync that was blocked

`blocked` is a verdict reached on evidence, and it comes with an instruction:
push those commits somewhere, then run again. When the sync could not reach a
verdict at all — git itself failed — the row says so instead:

```text
base sync failed: failed to read current branch: exit status 128
```

The two are separate statuses (`base-failed` and `base-blocked`) on purpose.
Nobody clears a failed row by pushing commits, and counting it among the
blocked ones makes the blocked count overstate how much work is outstanding.
Neither status changes the exit code: a base ref is a repair the command
offered, and failing at it must not report the pull you asked for as failed.

A repository with **no commits at all** — a fresh clone of an empty remote — is
neither. It has no base ref to sync and cannot have one until something is
committed, so it is skipped silently rather than listed as needing attention.
A repository that has commits but is sitting on an orphan branch (`git checkout --orphan`) is not in that class: its base ref is real and possibly stale, so it
is reported.

### The base is checked out somewhere

A base a linked worktree is standing on is reported and left alone, the same as
one checked out here: `base master is checked out in worktree celee__mbp__feat__x`.

This is not caution for its own sake. `git update-ref` is plumbing and enforces
no checkout rule — unlike `git branch -f`, it will move a branch out from under
a worktree, leaving that worktree's index disagreeing with its HEAD, so every
file the moved-off commits added reads as a staged deletion and the next commit
made there quietly reverts them. Finish or remove the worktree, then run again.

### Repositories with no local base branch at all

A clone that was switched to `develop` on day one may have no
`refs/heads/master`. The base then resolves to `develop` — the branch you are
standing on —
and the sync hands off to the normal pull path, so nothing is ever repaired and
`info`'s `BASE` column stays meaningless. Opt in to fixing it:

```bash
gz-git update --sync-base --create-missing-base -d 2 ~/projects
```

This creates the branch locally at the remote's tip. It requires `--sync-base`
and is off by default, because a repository deliberately kept without a local
trunk is a legitimate choice and creating a branch is not a repair.

Two things it deliberately will not do:

- **Retarget a base it could repair.** The create path only runs when the
  resolved base leaves nothing to fix — nothing resolved, or it resolved to the
  branch you are standing on. A repository with a stale local `master` gets that
  `master` repaired, not an unrelated `main` invented beside it. A base your
  config declares is never overridden either way.
- **Resurrect a branch deleted upstream.** Which branches exist is asked of the
  remote with `ls-remote`, not read out of `refs/remotes/`, so a tracking ref
  left behind by a deleted branch cannot become a local trunk. This is also why
  it finds `master` in a `clone --single-branch -b develop`, which has no
  `origin/master` ref to probe. It needs the network, so it does nothing under
  `--skip-fetch`.

### Doing it by hand

For a single repository:

```bash
git -C <repo> fetch origin master:master
```

The missing `+` is the safety net: that refspec refuses a non-fast-forward.

Resolution order: the `branch.defaultBranch` candidates from config, first one
that exists as a local ref; otherwise `main`, `master`, `develop`,
`development`. Sitting on the base branch prints nothing — HEAD cannot diverge
from itself.

## `push` failed but the message doesn't say why

Older builds reported only `push exited with code 128: exit status 128`,
discarding the stderr git had already produced. Current builds carry git's own
diagnosis on the same row:

```text
✗ tasuku-repo  origin: push exited with code 128: ERROR: Permission to iheanyi/tasuku.git denied to archmagece.
```

stderr is collapsed onto one line so the bulk table stays aligned — nothing is
truncated. On an older binary, reproduce the single repository by hand to see
the full text:

```bash
git -C <repo> push origin HEAD
```

## A repository pushes to a remote you don't own

A `permission denied` on push usually means `origin` points at an upstream you
only have read access to — common for a repository cloned directly rather than
from your own fork. Check where it actually points:

```bash
gz-git info -d3 | grep <repo>     # REMOTE column
git -C <repo> remote -v
```

Repoint it at your fork, or leave it read-only and expect `push` to keep
reporting it as failed.

## A bulk command printed nothing

Only `--quiet` fully silences a bulk command; `--format json` still prints. If
output is missing without `-q`, check the exit code before assuming the command
was skipped:

```bash
gz-git pull -d3; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

| Exit | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | all repositories processed successfully   |
| 1    | tool or configuration error (nothing ran) |
| 2    | one or more repositories failed           |

`--dry-run` reports the same scan without touching anything, which is the
cheapest way to confirm the command is finding your repositories at all.

## `integrate check` says bootstrap required or readiness contract changed

Before bootstrapping a repository, every wrapper or policy hook that can invoke
integration should require this exact probe to succeed:

```bash
gz-git capability integrate-readiness-v1
```

Unlike a version-string floor, this is the binary's explicit declaration that
it implements the named contract. Success exits zero and writes exactly
`integrate-readiness-v1` plus a newline to stdout, including with `--quiet`;
an older client, unknown capability, wrong arity, or output failure exits
nonzero and must fail closed.

Readiness V1 is owned by the target branch, not by a task branch. Add the
contract to the target in a separately approved bootstrap change, then rebase
task branches onto that target. A task branch cannot introduce, remove, or
weaken its own gate.

Repositories where neither target nor source declares readiness keep the
legacy head-owned Make gate and print an explicit warning. A source-only
declaration fails with `bootstrap required`; once the target declares V1, every
source must carry the identical readiness declaration and runner tree.

```yaml
branch:
  readiness:
    version: 1
    runner: .gz-git/readiness/check
```

The runner must be a tracked executable regular file (`100755`) below
`.gz-git/readiness/`. Contract runners are supported on macOS and Linux; on
Windows the check fails closed. `gz-git` runs it from a detached target-SHA worktree
with fixed `--source-dir`, `--source-sha`, `--target-sha`, and
`--result-format json-v1` arguments. It must return one JSON value such as:

```json
{"version":1,"status":"ready","summary":"validation passed"}
```

`ready`, `not_ready`, and `unavailable` are the only statuses. An unavailable
measurement, malformed result, timeout, changed runner tree, or changed
contract is never downgraded by `--allow-skipped-checks`.

V1 has a fixed 15-minute execution timeout. Standard output and standard error
are each limited to 1 MiB. Standard output must contain exactly one
duplicate-free JSON object with the three fields `version`, `status`, and
`summary`; unknown fields and trailing values are rejected. `summary` must be
valid UTF-8, nonempty, single-line text without control characters and at most
4096 bytes. A nonzero runner exit is an unavailable measurement.

The runner is isolated from the source checkout but is not a sandbox: it
inherits the normal toolchain, cache, credential, and temporary-directory
environment needed by repository validation. Selected shell-startup controls
and Git repository override variables are removed, and `LC_ALL`/`LANG` are
forced to `C`. The manifest cannot configure arguments, environment, cwd, or
timeout.

## `integrate check` reports a failing gate without its output

Failed legacy `make check` or `make lint` runs and failing target-owned
readiness runners write their captured output to a local diagnostic file. The
failing check row shows its absolute path. Files live under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME}/gz-git/integrate/diagnostics/`, or
`~/.local/state/gz-git/integrate/diagnostics/` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset
or relative. The directory is mode `0700` and files are mode `0600` because
tool output can contain secrets. Files persist after the temporary worktree is
removed; inspect them locally and delete individual files when no longer
needed. Successful checks create no diagnostic file.
On Windows, private POSIX permissions are unavailable, so the check reports
that diagnostic persistence is unsupported instead of writing a file.

## Controller-backed `integrate queue` is unavailable

Hooks or wrappers that require explicit controller queue semantics must probe
the exact capability before invoking `integrate queue --controller-config`:

```bash
gz-git capability integrate-queue-controller-v1
```

Success writes exactly `integrate-queue-controller-v1` plus a newline. A
missing or older binary must fail closed rather than falling back to repository
configuration: controller mode binds the selected remote, declared integration
branch, and optional task-pattern filter explicitly.

## `integrate check` reports a lint baseline that is not there

The lint gate can report hundreds of issues under a directory that no longer
exists — typically the worktree a previous `integrate run` just reclaimed:

```text
../../../worktrees/.../claude__mst__fix__push-stderr/pkg/repository/bulk_switch.go:318:92: ...
237 issues:
```

golangci-lint caches analysis results keyed by absolute path, and the cache
outlives the directory.

The gate no longer does this. `integrate check` runs the lint target with a
private `GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE` that it creates and removes per run, and any
diagnostic pointing outside the repository now fails the check by name instead
of being counted as a pre-existing baseline. If you still see it, your
installed binary predates that fix — see the next section.

Running `make lint` by hand is a different matter: it uses the shared cache,
so a reclaimed worktree can still haunt it. Clear the cache and re-run:

```bash
golangci-lint cache clean && GOWORK=off make lint
```

The tracked `go.work` deliberately contains only `use .`, so a worktree or a
standalone clone does not depend on sibling modules existing at relative paths.
`GOWORK=off` is still useful here because it keeps this manual lint run aligned
with the canonical quality gate and isolates it from any parent workspace.

## A gate fix does not take effect until `make install`

`integrate check` and `integrate run` are executed by the `gz-git` on your
PATH, not by the source tree you are standing in. A fix to the gate itself is
therefore invisible to the gate until it is installed:

```bash
GOWORK=off make install
```

This is easy to miss precisely because the change looks landed — it is
committed, it is on the integration branch, and its tests pass. The judgment
still comes from the binary. When a gate behaves in a way the current source
cannot explain, check what is actually running before investigating the code:

```bash
gz-git --version
strings "$(command -v gz-git)" | grep -c "<a string your fix introduced>"
```

The same applies in reverse: after installing a gate change, an unexpected new
failure may be the fix working rather than a regression.
