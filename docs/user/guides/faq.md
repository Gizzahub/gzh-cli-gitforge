- Easier debugging (same commands you'd run manually)
- Simpler implementation and maintenance

### Command not found after installation

If you see "command not found: gz-git":

1. **Check if Go bin is in PATH:**

   ```bash
   echo $PATH | grep go/bin
   ```

1. **Add Go bin to PATH:**

   ```bash
   # For bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

   # For zsh
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

1. **Verify installation:**

   ```bash
   which gz-git
   gz-git --version
   ```

## Usage Questions

### How do I check repository status?

```bash
# In current directory
gz-git status

# Specific repository
gz-git status /path/to/repo

# Quiet mode (exit code only)
gz-git status -q
```

Exit codes:

- `0`: Repository is clean
- `1`: Repository has changes

### How do I clone a repository?

```bash
# Basic clone
gz-git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone specific branch
gz-git clone -b develop https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Shallow clone (faster, saves disk space)
gz-git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone to specific directory
gz-git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-project
```

### What's the difference between gz-git and regular git?

For basic operations like `status` and `clone`, gz-git provides:

- Cleaner, more structured output
- Additional validation and safety checks
- Better error messages
- Library API for programmatic access

Advanced features are available now, adding automation and intelligence not available in standard Git.

### Can I use gz-git alongside regular git?

Yes! gz-git works with standard Git repositories. You can:

- Use gz-git for some operations
- Use regular git for others
- Mix both in the same workflow

They operate on the same `.git` directory and are fully compatible.

## Library Usage

### How do I use gz-git as a library?

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/gizzahub/gzh-cli-gitforge/pkg/repository"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    client := repository.NewClient()

    // Open repository
    repo, err := client.Open(ctx, ".")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Get status
    status, err := client.GetStatus(ctx, repo)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Clean: %v\n", status.IsClean)
}
```

See [Library Integration Guide](../LIBRARY.md) for more examples.

### Is the library API stable?

Current status (v0.3.0):

- Security audit completion
- Production deployment guides

### How do I integrate with gzh-cli?

gzh-cli-gitforge is designed to be the Git engine for [gzh-cli](https://github.com/gizzahub/gzh-cli):

```go
import "github.com/gizzahub/gzh-cli-gitforge/pkg/repository"

// Use in gzh-cli commands
client := repository.NewClient()
repo, _ := client.Open(ctx, repoPath)
```

Full integration planned for v1.0.0 release.

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository" error

This error means you're trying to run gz-git in a directory that isn't a Git repository.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if current directory is a Git repo
git status

# Initialize new repository
git init

# Or navigate to existing repository
cd /path/to/git/repo
```

### Clone fails with "Permission denied"

**Possible causes:**

1. **SSH key not configured** (for SSH URLs)
1. **No access to repository** (private repo)
1. **Network issues**

**Solutions:**

```bash
# For SSH: Check SSH key
ssh -T git@github.com

# For HTTPS: Use personal access token
git clone https://username:token@github.com/user/repo.git

# Check network connectivity
ping github.com
```

### Performance: Why is gz-git slower than git?

gz-git adds a thin layer on top of Git for:

- Input validation
- Output parsing
- Safety checks

Overhead is typically 10-50ms. For large operations (clone, fetch), the overhead is negligible compared to network time.

**Optimization tips:**

- Use `--depth 1` for faster clones
- Use `-q` flag to reduce output processing
- For bulk operations, use library API with parallelization

### How do I report bugs or request features?

1. **Check existing issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gizzahub/gzh-cli-gitforge/issues)
1. **Search documentation**: [docs/](../)
1. **Create new issue**: Use issue templates

**Include in bug reports:**

- gz-git version (`gz-git --version`)
- Git version (`git --version`)
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Advanced Questions

### Does gz-git support Git hooks?

Git hooks work normally with gz-git since it uses standard Git repositories. Future versions may add hook automation features.

### Can I use custom commit templates?

Yes! gz-git supports custom commit templates:

```bash
# List available templates
gz-git commit template list

# Show template details
gz-git commit template show conventional

# Use auto-commit (uses default template)
gz-git commit auto
```

You can create custom templates in `~/.config/gz-git/templates/` directory.

### What about submodules?

Submodule support is planned for future releases. Current version focuses on core repository operations.

### Is there a GUI or TUI?

Current version is CLI-only. Terminal UI (TUI) is being considered for future versions.

### How does gz-git handle credentials?

gz-git uses Git's credential system:

- SSH keys (via SSH agent)
- HTTPS credentials (via Git credential helper)
- Personal access tokens

No credentials are stored or logged by gz-git.

### Can I extend gz-git with plugins?

Plugin architecture is planned for v2.0+. Current version focuses on core stability.
