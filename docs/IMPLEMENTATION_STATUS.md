# Implementation Status Report

> **Generated**: 2025-12-01
> **Version**: v0.1.0-alpha

## Test Coverage

**Current Status**: 69.1% coverage, 141 tests passing

**Test Files Found**:

## Documentation Discrepancies

### Critical Issues

1. **README.md**:
   - Lists commit/branch/history/merge as "Planned Features (Coming Soon)"
   - Should list as "Currently Available"
   - Roadmap shows phases 2-5 as incomplete

2. **FAQ (docs/user/guides/faq.md)**:
   - States "Current version doesn't support this yet" for implemented features
   - Lists features as "planned for v0.2.0-v0.5.0"

3. **First Steps Tutorial (docs/user/getting-started/first-steps.md)**:
   - Only demonstrates basic clone/status/info
   - Marks advanced features as "planned"
   - Should include working examples of all features

4. **LLM Context (docs/llm/CONTEXT.md)**:
   - Correctly marks features as "PLANNED"
   - Needs update to reflect actual implementation

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Priority 1)

1. **Update README.md**:
   - Move all implemented features from "Planned" to "Currently Available"
   - Update roadmap to show phases 2-5 as completed
   - Update version targets

2. **Update FAQ**:
   - Change "not yet implemented" to "available in v0.1.0-alpha"
   - Update feature availability information
   - Add usage examples for implemented features

3. **Update First Steps Tutorial**:
   - Add examples of commit auto, branch management
   - Demonstrate history analysis
   - Show merge/rebase workflows

### Short-term (Priority 2)

4. **Create Comprehensive Command Reference**:
   - Document all subcommands
   - Add usage examples
   - Include output samples

5. **Update LLM Context**:
   - Move features from "Planned" to "Implemented"
   - Update implementation status sections

6. **Add Feature Demonstration Examples**:
   - Working code samples in `examples/`
   - Real-world use case tutorials

### Medium-term (Priority 3)

7. **API Documentation**:
   - Generate GoDoc for all packages
   - Create API reference documentation
   - Add integration examples

8. **Version Strategy**:
   - Consider releasing as v0.5.0 or v1.0.0-beta
   - Current "v0.1.0-alpha" severely underrepresents maturity
   - Establish proper versioning going forward

## Build & Test Verification

```bash
# Build successful
$ make build
✓ Built gzh-git successfully

# Commands functional
$ ./gzh-git status
✓ Working

$ ./gzh-git info
✓ Working

$ ./gzh-git --help
✓ Shows all commands

# Test coverage
$ make test

✓ 69.1% coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Create implementation status document (this file) ✅
2. Update README.md with correct feature status
3. Update FAQ with implemented features
4. Update tutorials with working examples
5. Consider version number adjustment
6. Plan proper v1.0.0 release

## Conclusion

The gzh-cli-git project is **significantly more mature** than documentation suggests. All planned features for phases 2-5 are already implemented and functional. The project is ready for a proper beta or even v1.0.0 release, not v0.1.0-alpha.

**Recommendation**: Update all documentation to reflect actual implementation status and consider bumping version to v0.5.0-beta or v1.0.0-rc1.
