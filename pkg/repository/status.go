// Status constants for bulk operations.

// Status Display Guidelines:
//   - Changes occurred: "N↓ fetched", "N↓ pulled", "N↑ pushed"
//   - No changes: "up-to-date" (unified across all commands)
//   - Icons: ✓ (changes), = (no changes), ✗ (error), ⚠ (warning), ⊘ (skipped)

	// StatusError indicates an error occurred during the operation.

	// StatusSkipped indicates the repository was skipped (e.g., uncommitted changes).
	StatusSkipped = "skipped"

	// StatusUpToDate indicates the repository is already up to date (no changes needed).
	// This is the unified status for "no changes" across fetch, pull, and push.
	StatusUpToDate = "up-to-date"

	// StatusUpdated indicates the repository was successfully updated (generic).
	StatusUpdated = "updated"

	// StatusSuccess indicates the operation completed successfully (generic).
	// Prefer specific statuses (StatusFetched, StatusPulled, StatusPushed) when possible.

	// StatusPushed indicates commits were successfully pushed to remote.

	// StatusNoRemote indicates no remote is configured for the repository.

	StatusNoUpstream = "no-upstream"

	// StatusNoCommits indicates the repository has no commits at all, so there
	// is nothing that could be pushed.
	//
	// It is separate from StatusError because the two are cleared by different
	// actions and only one of them is the user's to clear. Without this status a
	// `--refspec HEAD:master` run reports an empty repository as "source branch
	// 'HEAD' does not exist", which is textually true and diagnostically wrong:
	// it reads as "you named a branch that isn't here" when the fact is "nothing
	// is here yet". The first is a typo in the command; the second is a
	// repository that was created and never used. A person scanning an error
	// list for real push failures has to open the second kind to find out it was
	// never a target, and in a bulk run over a hundred repositories that cost is
	// paid on every run.
	StatusNoCommits = "no-commits"

	// StatusBaseBlocked indicates the repository's own branch updated cleanly
	// but its local base ref diverged from the remote and was left untouched.
	// It is a distinct status rather than a note on a success because a base ref
	// holding commits the remote has never seen is exactly the state a user
	// needs to look at, and a row that renders as "up-to-date" is not looked at.
	StatusBaseBlocked = "base-blocked"

	// StatusBaseFailed indicates the base sync could not run to a decision, as
	// opposed to reaching one the user must act on. It is separate from
	// StatusBaseBlocked so the blocked list stays a list of repositories that
	// need a person: a row saying "git failed here" is real, but nobody clears
	// it by pushing commits, and counting it alongside the ones they can clear
	// makes the count lie about how much work is outstanding.
	StatusBaseFailed = "base-failed"

	// StatusBaseSynced indicates a local base ref was advanced to its remote.
	// Moving a ref is a write to the user's repository, and a write reported as
	// "up-to-date" is a write the user never sees. This status exists so the row
	// survives the renderer's issue filter and can say which ref moved and by how
	// much, rather than repairing refs invisibly.
