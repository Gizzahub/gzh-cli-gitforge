// TestPrepareSymmetry pins the property TASK-140 is about: with no controller
// profile the two probes are NOT measured in the same kind of tree, and that
// difference has to be reported as the reason rather than left as an unstated
// premise.
//
// The branch probe runs where the repository already is — the live working
// directory, carrying deps/, node_modules/ and .venv from earlier runs — while
// the baseline probe runs in a worktree checked out fresh at the target SHA
// and bootstrapped by nothing. Running the same `make` target in those two
// trees is not the same experiment, so a bootstrap-hungry checker dies on the
// baseline side only. Reporting that as "the target tip failed" points the
// operator at a commit that is innocent.
//
// This repository's own gate is what these probes decide, so the asymmetry is
// recorded rather than removed: symmetrizing would charge every gate run a
// full bootstrap. The stated reason is the deliverable, and it only exists if
// every link in the chain stamps its tree — prepareLegacyTrees, annotateProbe,
// baselineAgainstTarget, BaselineInput, unmeasurableReason. The end-to-end
// subtest below is the one that holds all five at once.
