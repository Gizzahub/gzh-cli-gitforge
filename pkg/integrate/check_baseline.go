// gz-git invokes a repository's own `make check` / `make lint`; it does not

// liftToTracked resolves a diagnostic path emitted relative to a subdirectory
// back to its repository-root form. It answers only when exactly one tracked
// path ends with the given path: several candidates means the evidence does
// not say which file the tool meant, and picking one would attribute a
// diagnostic to a file the branch may never have touched.
//
// Several candidates means several distinct ones. The tracked list is not
// guaranteed to be a set, and a name repeated in it is still one file: refusing
// on the second sighting of the same path would turn a duplicate entry into a
// lost lift, which is ambiguity reported where none exists.
//
// A path with no directory component of its own is refused outright, however
// unique its match. Go's testing package decorates every t.Log and t.Errorf
// line with filepath.Base, so "a_test.go:10" is the ordinary output of a test
// that skipped cleanly — and suppressGoTestVerboseNoise cannot always blank
// it, because an interleaved "=== CONT" clears the pending buffer before the
// trailer that would identify the line as noise arrives. Lifting a bare base
// name would resolve that line to a real tracked path and hand it to rule (a),
// which is a hard failure: a branch that merely touched a test file would be
// blocked by a skip message present on both sides. A suffix long enough to
// carry a directory is weak evidence of the tool's working directory; a bare
// file name is no evidence at all, so the safe answer is the pre-existing
// one — do not lift, and let the changed-paths rule stay silent.
//
// Two costs come with that refusal, and neither is hypothetical.
//
// The refusal covers only this lift. One line up, normalizeTrackedPath still
// answers an exact tracked match, and at a repository root a bare name can be
// exactly tracked — this repository has version_test.go there. A cleanly
// skipping root-level test therefore still reaches rule (a) and hard-fails the
// branch. The gate below narrows that class; it does not close it, and saying
// the changed-paths rule stays silent would overstate what this does.
//
// The refusal also forfeits real attribution. A recipe doing
// "cd src && gcc -c foo.c" makes gcc print foo.c:12:5: with no directory of
// its own, and that diagnostic is now permanently unattributable even though
// src/foo.c is tracked and unambiguous. The trade is deliberate: a wrong
// attribution hard-blocks an innocent branch, while a missing one only falls
// back to the count heuristic. Both costs are paid off by the same fix —
// reading the tool's real working directory rather than guessing it from a
// suffix.

// normalizeTrackedPath maps a diagnostic path onto the revision's tracked
// paths. Tools disagree about what a path is relative to, in both directions:
// a wrapper may print an over-qualified path, and a recipe that does
// "cd apps/api && mix compile" makes its tool print lib/foo.ex for a file the
// repository knows as apps/api/lib/foo.ex.
//
// Stripping alone only handled the first direction, so on a repository whose
// Makefile cds into a subdirectory — the shape missingCD already exists to
// cope with — every diagnostic path was ground down to a bare base name that
// matches no changed path. The changed-paths rule, the one piece of
// EvaluateBaseline that is direct evidence of harm rather than a count
// heuristic, could therefore never fire there at all.
//
// The lift is attempted on the path as emitted, before any component is
// stripped. Stripping first would grind a build-artifact copy such as
// _build/dev/lib/foo.ex down to lib/foo.ex and then lift that onto the source
// file it was generated from, which is a different file with a different
// history. Lifting first leaves it alone, because no tracked path ends with
// the artifact's full prefix.
//
// That ordering is not a guarantee, only the cheap half of one. It protects an
// artifact tree nested deeper than its source; an artifact emitted as
// dist/bundle.js still lifts onto a tracked src/dist/bundle.js, because a
// unique suffix match is a coincidence and this function cannot tell a
// coincidence from a working directory. The sound fix is to read the tool's
// real cwd — make's "Entering directory" markers, or the recipe cd that
// missingCD already parses — and treat a known prefix as exact.
//
// The lift is deliberately incomplete in the other direction too. A recipe
// doing "cd apps/api && mix compile" that reports mix.exs:3 — a name with no
// directory of its own — stays unlifted, because liftToTracked refuses a bare
// base name outright and cannot make an exception for one file. That is a
// false negative the changed-paths rule absorbs quietly; the alternative is
// the false positive that gate exists to prevent.
//
// The incoming path is cleaned rather than merely stripped of a leading "./",
// so lib//foo.ex and sub/../lib/foo.ex reach the same tracked file that
// lib/foo.ex does. Cleaning cannot invent a directory, so it never turns a
