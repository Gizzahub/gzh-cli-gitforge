# Branch Cleanup with gz-git

This skill covers branch cleanup operations using `gz-git cleanup branch`.

## Overview

| Cleanup Type | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--merged`   | Branches fully merged into base branch         |
| `--stale`    | Branches with no activity for N days           |
| `--gone`     | Branches whose remote tracking branch deleted  |

**Key Feature**: Bulk mode by default - cleans up across all repos in directory.

---

## Safety First: Dry-Run Default

**gz-git cleanup branch is DRY-RUN by default.** Nothing is deleted until you add `--force`.

```bash
# Preview only (safe)
gz-git cleanup branch --merged

# Actually delete
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force
```

---

## Quick Start

### Single Repository

```bash
# Preview merged branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged

# Delete merged branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force

# Preview stale branches (30+ days)
gz-git cleanup branch --stale

# Delete stale branches
gz-git cleanup branch --stale --force

# Preview gone branches
gz-git cleanup branch --gone

# Combine types
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --stale --gone --force
```

### Bulk Mode (Multiple Repos)

```bash
# Preview across all repos in current dir
gz-git cleanup branch --merged .

# Delete across all repos
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force .

# Scan deeper (2 levels)
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force -d 2 ~/repos

# Include/exclude patterns
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --include "api-*" .
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --exclude "legacy-*" .
```

---

## Cleanup Types

### Merged Branches (`--merged`)

Branches fully merged into the base branch (main/master/develop).

```bash
# Preview merged branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged

# Output:
# Repository: project-api
#   feature/login       → merged into main
#   feature/signup      → merged into main
#   fix/typo            → merged into main
#
# Would delete 3 branches (dry-run)
```

**Auto-detection**: Base branch is auto-detected from:
1. `main` (if exists)
2. `master` (if exists)
3. Default branch from remote

```bash
# Override base branch
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --base develop
```

### Stale Branches (`--stale`)

Branches with no commits for N days (default: 30).

```bash
# Preview stale branches (30+ days)
gz-git cleanup branch --stale

# Custom threshold (60 days)
gz-git cleanup branch --stale --stale-days 60

# Output:
# Repository: project-api
#   feature/old-idea    → last commit 45 days ago
#   experiment/test     → last commit 120 days ago
#
# Would delete 2 branches (dry-run)
```

### Gone Branches (`--gone`)

Branches whose upstream tracking branch was deleted (usually after PR merge).

```bash
# Preview gone branches
gz-git cleanup branch --gone

# Output:
# Repository: project-api
#   feature/merged-pr   → upstream gone (origin/feature/merged-pr deleted)
#
# Would delete 1 branch (dry-run)
```

**Common Scenario**: After merging a PR on GitHub/GitLab, the remote branch is deleted, but your local branch remains. `--gone` cleans these up.

---

## Protected Branches

Some branches are **always protected** and never deleted:

| Protected by Default |
| -------------------- |
| `main`               |
| `master`             |
| `develop`            |
| `development`        |
| `release/*`          |
| `hotfix/*`           |

### Add Custom Protected Branches

```bash
# Protect additional branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --protect "staging,qa,prod" --force

# Protect with patterns
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --protect "env/*,deploy/*" --force
```

### Profile-Based Protection

In your profile or project config:

```yaml
# ~/.config/gz-git/profiles/work.yaml
branch:
  defaultBranch: main
  protectedBranches:
    - main
    - master
    - develop
    - staging
    - release/*
```

---

## Remote Branch Deletion

By default, only **local branches** are deleted. To also delete remote branches:

```bash
# Delete local + remote branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --remote --force

# Output:
# Repository: project-api
#   feature/login       → deleted (local)
#   feature/login       → deleted (origin)
```

**Warning**: Remote deletion is permanent. Use dry-run first!

```bash
# Preview remote deletion
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --remote
```

## Bulk Mode Options

| Flag           | Default | Description                        |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `-d, --scan-depth` | `1`  | Directory depth to scan            |
| `-j, --parallel`   | `10` | Parallel operations                |
| `--include`    | -       | Regex pattern to include repos     |
| `--exclude`    | -       | Regex pattern to exclude repos     |
| `--recursive`  | `false` | Include nested repos/submodules    |

```bash
# Scan 2 levels deep
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force -d 2 ~/repos

# Only frontend repos
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --include "frontend-*" .

# Exclude vendor repos
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --exclude "vendor|third-party" .

# Include submodules
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --recursive .
```

---

## Interactive Wizard

For guided cleanup:

```bash
gz-git cleanup wizard

# Interactive prompts:
# ? Select cleanup type: [merged/stale/gone/all]
# ? Include remote branches? [y/N]
# ? Protect additional branches: staging, qa
# ? Proceed with deletion? [y/N]
```

---

## Common Workflows

### After PR Merge

```bash
# 1. Fetch to update remote refs
gz-git fetch --prune

# 2. Clean up gone branches
gz-git cleanup branch --gone --force
```

### Weekly Maintenance

```bash
# Preview all cleanup types
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --stale --gone .

# Review output, then execute
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --stale --gone --force .
```

### Pre-Release Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up merged feature branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force .

# Clean up stale branches (90+ days)
gz-git cleanup branch --stale --stale-days 90 --force .
```

### Monorepo Cleanup

```bash
# Scan entire monorepo (deep)
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force -d 3 --recursive ~/monorepo

# Exclude certain paths
gz-git cleanup branch --merged --force --exclude "vendor|node_modules" .
```

---

## Output Examples

### Dry-Run Output

```
Scanning repositories...

Repository: project-core (main)
  Merged branches:
    feature/auth        → merged into main (2 days ago)
    feature/api         → merged into main (5 days ago)
  Stale branches:
    experiment/old      → last commit 45 days ago

Repository: project-api (main)
  Merged branches:
    fix/bug-123         → merged into main (1 day ago)
  Gone branches:
    feature/pr-456      → upstream deleted

Summary:
  Repositories scanned: 2
  Branches to delete:   5

[DRY-RUN] Use --force to actually delete branches
```

### Force Output

```
Scanning repositories...

Repository: project-core (main)
  ✓ Deleted: feature/auth
  ✓ Deleted: feature/api
  ✓ Deleted: experiment/old

Repository: project-api (main)
  ✓ Deleted: fix/bug-123
  ✓ Deleted: feature/pr-456

Summary:
  Repositories processed: 2
  Branches deleted:       5
  Errors:                 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### "branch is not fully merged"

The branch has commits not in the base branch.

```bash
# Check if really merged
git log main..feature/branch

# Force delete (careful!)
git branch -D feature/branch
```

### "protected branch cannot be deleted"

Branch is in protected list.

```bash
# Check protected branches
gz-git cleanup branch --merged -v

# Remove from protection (if intentional)
# Edit profile or use different base
```

### "failed to delete remote branch"

Remote deletion needs push permission.

```bash
# Check remote access
git push origin --delete feature/branch

# May need force push permission
```

### "no branches to clean up"

```bash
# Ensure fetch is up-to-date
gz-git fetch --prune .

# Check with verbose
gz-git cleanup branch --merged -v .

# Try different types
gz-git cleanup branch --stale --stale-days 7 .
```
