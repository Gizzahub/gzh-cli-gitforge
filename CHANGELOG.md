<!-- size-limit: 1000 -->

<!-- A changelog is an append-only record, not a guide read front to back, so the
     default 500-line document budget models the wrong genre.

     1000 is a ceiling, not an exemption, and it is sized from measurement: the
     2026-08 backlog was 460 lines across 78 entries, so one release's worth of
     changes fits in the headroom above the current length. Hitting it therefore
     means a release is overdue, not that this file needs trimming — cut the
     release and move that line into docs/changelog/.

     Do not shrink the budget to a value a single batch can exhaust mid-write.
     Exceeding it is a hard error that blocks edits to this file, and the remedy
     is itself an edit to this file — that is how the 2026-08-07 to 2026-08-24
     gap happened, when 71 commits went unrecorded behind a 45KB limit. -->

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Entries explain *why* a change was made — that is the part a generator cannot produce,
and the reason this file is written by hand. Keep each entry to roughly 3-5 lines and
group related commits into one entry; the exhaustive per-commit list is generated into
the GitHub Release notes by `.goreleaser.yaml` (`changelog.use: github`) and does not
belong here. When `[Unreleased]` outgrows the repository's document size gate, the fix
is to cut a release and move that line into `docs/changelog/`, not to write less.

## Source-version milestones

Earlier 0.x files record source-version milestones. v0.8.0 (2026-10-01) was the first
stable published tag, and 0.9.0 (2026-10-02) and 0.9.1 (2026-10-08) continue the stable line. This file
carries only unreleased changes.

| Line                           | Milestones                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [0.9.x](docs/changelog/0.9.md) | 0.9.1 (2026-10-08), 0.9.0 (2026-10-02) |
| [0.8.x](docs/changelog/0.8.md) | 0.8.0 (2026-10-01)                     |
| [0.7.x](docs/changelog/0.7.md) | 0.7.0 (2026-07-02)                     |

| [0.4.x](docs/changelog/0.4.md) | 0.4.0 (2026-01-02)                     |
| [0.3.x](docs/changelog/0.3.md) | 0.3.1 (2025-12-02), 0.3.0 (2025-12-01) |
| [0.2.x](docs/changelog/0.2.md) | 0.2.0 (2025-12-01)                     |
| [0.1.x](docs/changelog/0.1.md) | 0.1.0-alpha (2025-12-01)               |

The mechanical per-commit list is not copied here; `.goreleaser.yaml`
(`changelog.use: github`) generates it into the GitHub Release notes.
