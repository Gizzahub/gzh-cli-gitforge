## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-02

### Added

**Bulk Commit Command** - Multi-Repository Commit with Custom Messages:

- `gz-git commit` is now bulk-enabled by default (breaking change from `commit bulk` subcommand)
  - Scans multiple repositories and commits changes in parallel
  - Preview mode by default (use `--yes` to commit)
  - Auto-generates commit messages based on file changes
  - Supports multiple message input methods

**Per-Repository Custom Messages** - New `--messages` CLI Flag:

- `--messages "repo:message"` flag for inline custom messages (repeatable)
  - Format: `--messages "frontend:feat: add feature" --messages "backend:fix: bug"`
  - Supports relative path, base name, or full path matching
  - Works alongside existing `-m`, `--messages-file`, and `-e` options
- MessageGenerator pattern for flexible message lookup
- Falls back to auto-generated messages when no custom message matches

**Commit Workflow Features**:

- Interactive message editing with `$EDITOR` via `-e` flag
- JSON file support for batch message customization via `--messages-file`
- Common message for all repos via `-m` flag
- Multiple output formats: default, compact, json
- Filtering with `--include` and `--exclude` patterns
- Parallel processing with `-j` flag (default: 5)
- Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` flag

### Removed

**Breaking: Commit Subcommands Removed**:

- `gz-git commit auto` - Removed (use main `commit` command)
- `gz-git commit validate` - Removed (commit message validation)
- `gz-git commit template` - Removed (template management)
- `gz-git commit bulk` - Removed (merged into main command)

**Package Cleanup**:

- Deleted `pkg/commit` package (generator, template, validator, push functionality)
- All commit functionality is now in the CLI layer only

### Fixed

**File Path Truncation Bug** - Critical Git Status Parsing Fix:

- Fixed bug where first character of file paths was truncated in JSON output
  - Example: `internal/test.go` → `nternal/test.go`
  - Affected: `bulk_commit.go`, `generator.go`, `parallel.go`, `bulk_diff.go`
- Root cause: `strings.TrimSpace()` applied before line splitting
- Solution: Split first, then TrimSpace each line, use `line[2:]` instead of `line[3:]`
- Added regression test `TestFilePathParsing` to prevent future issues

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `commit bulk` subcommand → `commit` main command (bulk-by-default)
- Refactored commit command architecture for better code reuse
- Renamed `displayCommitResults` → `displayCommitBulkResults` to avoid namespace collision

### Documentation

- Updated README.md with v0.4.0 features and examples
- Added comprehensive commit command usage examples
- Updated version badges and feature lists

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

**Improved CLI Output** - Enhanced Status Display:

- `branch list`: Show upstream tracking status with `↑`/`↓` indicators

  - `(origin/main) ✓` - up-to-date with upstream
  - `(origin/main) 3↑` - 3 commits ahead
  - `(origin/main) 2↓` - 2 commits behind
  - `(origin/main) 3↑ 2↓` - diverged (ahead and behind)

- `fetch`: Compact one-line output with behind/ahead status

  - Shows `N↓` for commits behind remote after fetch
  - Shows `N↑` for commits ahead of remote

- `pull`: Compact one-line output with status indicators

  - Shows pulled commits count
  - `[stash]` indicator when auto-stash was used

**Bulk Pull Command** - Parallel Repository Pull with Merge Strategies:

- `gz-git pull` command for bulk pulling from multiple repositories
  - Three merge strategies: `merge` (default), `rebase`, `ff-only`
  - Smart detection of remote and upstream configuration
  - Automatic stash/pop for local changes with `--stash` flag
  - Context-aware operations with ahead/behind tracking
- CLI Features:
  - `-d, --depth` flag for directory depth scanning
  - `--strategy` flag: merge, rebase, ff-only
  - `--stash` flag: auto-stash local changes before pull
  - `--watch` mode: continuous pulling at intervals (default: 1m)
  - `--dry-run`: preview without actual pull
  - `--parallel`: concurrent pull operations (default: 5)
  - `--include/--exclude`: regex filtering
  - `--format`: default or compact output
- Status icons: ✓ success, ✗ error, = up-to-date, ⚠ no-remote/no-upstream
- Fills functionality gap between `fetch` (download only) and `update` (single repo)
- Respects Git semantics: pull = fetch + merge/rebase

**Watch Mode for Fetch** - Continuous Remote Monitoring:

- `--watch` and `--interval` flags for fetch command
  - Continuously fetches from multiple repositories at intervals
  - Default interval: 5 minutes (appropriate for remote operations)
  - Performs initial fetch immediately
  - Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C signal handling
  - Continues watching even if individual fetch operations error
- Usage:
  - `gz-git fetch -d 2 --watch --interval 5m ~/projects`
  - `gz-git fetch --watch --interval 1m ~/work`

**Nested Repository Scanning** - Intelligent Multi-Level Repository Discovery:

- `--include-submodules` flag for bulk fetch operations
  - **Default behavior**: Scans independent nested repositories, excludes git submodules
  - **With flag**: Includes git submodules in the scan
- Smart submodule detection using `.git` file vs directory differentiation
- Recursive scanning of nested repository structures at any depth level
- Respects `--max-depth` limit to prevent infinite recursion

**Submodule Detection**:

- Distinguishes between git submodules and independent nested repositories
- Submodules identified by `.git` file (not directory) pointing to parent's `.git/modules/`
- Independent nested repos have their own `.git` directory with complete object database
- Configurable scanning strategy via `IncludeSubmodules` option in both `BulkFetchOptions` and `BulkUpdateOptions`

**Scanning Strategy**:

- Always scans root directory (depth 0) and its children
- For repositories at depth > 0:
  - Skips submodules by default (unless `--include-submodules` is set)
  - Continues scanning independent nested repos to find more nested structures
  - Properly handles deeply nested repository hierarchies
- Skips hidden directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, etc.) for performance

### Testing

**Nested Repository Tests** (2 comprehensive scenarios):

- `TestBulkFetchNestedRepositories`: Tests multi-level nested repo discovery
  - Verifies 4-level nested repository structure detection (parent → nested1 → nested2 → deep-nested)
  - Tests max-depth limiting (stops at configured depth)
  - All nested repos correctly found and processed
- Integration with existing 8 bulk fetch tests (all passing)

### Changed

**CLI Improvements** - Ergonomic Shorthand Flags:

- **Simplified `--max-depth` flag to `-d, --depth`** for better ergonomics

  - Shorter, more intuitive flag for frequently used command
  - Consistent with Unix conventions (du -d, fd -d)
  - Breaking change: `--max-depth` flag removed (clean breaking change)
  - Affects: `fetch` and `pull` commands

- **Added GNU/Git convention shorthand flags** for common operations:

  - `-j, --parallel`: Parallel operations (make -j convention)
  - `-n, --dry-run`: Preview without executing (GNU convention)
  - `-t, --tags`: Fetch all tags (git fetch -t convention)
  - `-p, --prune`: Prune deleted remote branches (git convention)
  - `-r, --recursive`: Renamed from `--include-submodules` (GNU convention)

- **Renamed `--include-submodules` to `--recursive`**:

  - More intuitive and follows GNU conventions (cp -r, grep -r)
  - Applies to both fetch and pull commands
  - Breaking change for better consistency

### Fixed

**Bug Fixes**:

- Fixed `isSubmodule()` false positive detection
  - Previous: Incorrectly identified independent nested repos as submodules when parent had `.gitmodules`
  - Fixed: Now only checks `.git` file type, not parent `.gitmodules` existence
- Fixed `walkDirectoryWithConfig()` early return preventing nested repo discovery
  - Previous: Returned early when finding independent nested repos, preventing child scanning
  - Fixed: Continues scanning to find deeply nested structures
- Fixed `inferScope()` flaky test due to Go map iteration randomness
  - Added alphabetical tiebreaker for deterministic scope selection
- Fixed deadlock in `pkg/watch` Stop() method
  - Released mutex before calling wg.Wait() to avoid deadlock with eventLoop goroutine
- Fixed history contributors showing 0 for Additions/Deletions
  - Root cause: Parser broke on empty line between timestamp and numstat
  - Now correctly parses `git log --format=%ct --numstat` output
- Fixed example files to match current API
  - Updated `examples/commit/main.go`, `examples/branch/main.go`, `examples/history/main.go`, `examples/merge/main.go`

**Refactoring**:

- Extracted status constants in `pkg/repository/status.go`
  - 10 constants: StatusError, StatusSkipped, StatusUpToDate, StatusUpdated, StatusSuccess, StatusNoRemote, StatusNoUpstream, StatusWouldUpdate, StatusWouldFetch, StatusWouldPull
  - 3 helper functions: IsSuccessStatus(), IsDryRunStatus(), IsErrorStatus()
  - Replaced 30 hardcoded status strings in bulk.go

### Testing

- Added 16 unit tests for branch ahead/behind parsing functions
- Added unit tests for `inferScope()` deterministic behavior
- All watch package tests now passing (previously deadlocked)

### Documentation
